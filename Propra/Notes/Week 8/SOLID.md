# SOLID
- Is an acronym for:
	- Single responsibility.
	- Open/closed principle.
	- Liskov Substitution.
	- Interface segregation.
	- Dependency inversion.

All are great programming practices that we should keep in the foreground when designing software.

Quick repetition:

- Single responsibility: every class should have one responsibility.
- Open/closed principle: code should be open to extension and closed for modification.
- Liskov substitution: we should be able to use a subclass instead of a superclass and not lose functionality.
- Interface segregation: make your intersections as small as possible, but as big as necessary.
- Dependency inversion: abstractions should not depend on implementation details. Implementation details should depend on abstractions.
